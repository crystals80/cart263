# Project 2: Anythingâ„¢ Proposal - Escape the Gamingverse

For this project, I used Jquery Core 3.6.0 minified and Jquery UI 1.13 minified. Jquery scripts acquired [here](https://releases.jquery.com/). As for p5.js libraries, I used the minified version too. Download the most recent p5.min.js from [here](https://p5js.org/download/) and the most recent p5.sound.min.js from [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound/blob/main/lib/p5.sound.min.js)
