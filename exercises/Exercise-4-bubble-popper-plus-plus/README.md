# Exercise 4: Musical Bubble Popper

This fourth exercise is inspired from its tutorial "Bubble Popper," which has no sound but the interaction with the program through ml5.js handpose. That said, to spice things up, I decided to add music notes and let the user create their own little sound session. Everything was coded except for the musical notes image, which was taken from Flaticon.

To be honest, I appreciate this exercise but I did not have a good time because the program keeps lagging and is really slow so if there is an error or something wrong that isn't supposed to happened, I won't know until a little while later...Otherwise, I enjoyed coding with ml5.js handpose. It was challenging since I never created a class of inheritance using variables that are directly part of the library. Also, I still have difficulty to figure out how to restart the simulation properly, meaning no glitchy states skipping the simulation to so straight to the last state...I tried reset() but it needs a variable before it (i.e. var.reset()). I also tried removeElements() but this is for divs and I don't have any divs so it is still no good. I tried remove() and it is not something I would recommend for now because it clear everything including canvas. So until I know how to bring everything back to function properly, I will use the easy-peasy refresh keyboard buttons.

JS radial gradient code was inspired from Kazuki Umeda's Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUOweQ6wac&t=37s
