# Exercise 7: Riddle Expert

This seventh exercise takes after its tutorial activity "Code Taker" and was enhanced to make it more fun. As the tutorial of this exercise was already quite simple, I wanted to make the simulation more interactive by replacing the text and secret mesages with riddles.

For this exercise, there were no difficulty as I stuck to simplicity and keep everything simple yet fun. I did try to experiment with jQuery UI events, interactions and effects and did ran into some walls but I solved it quickly by either finding typos or dropping the idea to move on. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
