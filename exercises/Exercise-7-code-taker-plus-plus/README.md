# Exercise 7: Code Taker++

This seventh exercise takes after its tutorial activity "Code Taker" and was enhanced to make it more fun. As the tutorial of this exercise was already quite simple, I wanted to add more animations to create a better sense of "top secret".

[Here is the website for the "top secret" text](https://topsecretrecipes.com/dominos-chocolate-lava-crunch-cakes-copycat-recipe.html?category_id=32).

Once again, I coded the stamps using a code from Pete Blatchford called ["Rubber Stamp Effect"](https://codepen.io/555/pen/pdwvBP). So there is some CSS to enhance the visual of the simulation as I didn't know how to give the stamp the scratched-out effect in Javascript. For this exercise, there were no difficulty as I stuck to simplicity and keep everything simple yet fun. As for the [Domino's website link for this recipe](https://www.dominos.ca/en/pages/order/menu#!/menu/category/desserts/) (A delicious dessert worth trying!).
