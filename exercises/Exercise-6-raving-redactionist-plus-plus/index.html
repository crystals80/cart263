      <span class="stamp">TOP SECRET RECIPES VERSION OF</span>
      <span class="stamp recipe">DOMINO'S CHOCOLATE LAVA CRUNCH CAKES</span>
      <h2>** DO NOT DISTRIBUTE! **</h2>
      <p id="para-1">A traditional “molten” cake or “lava” cake is <span class="redacted top-secret">baked at a high temperature for a short time</span> so that the outside of the cake is fully cooked, <span class="redacted top-secret">but the batter
          at the center stays unset and gooey</span>. Domino’s lava cakes are different with pure fudge topping hidden in the middle rather than cake batter. The little dessert is delicious, with a crunchy exterior and two forms of chocolate in one
        bite, but it presents some challenges, such as how to fully enclose soft fudge in the center of a small cake <span class="redacted top-secret">without holes</span>, and <span class="redacted top-secret">how to keep the fudge from
          disappearing</span> into the cake batter as it bakes.</p>
      <p id="para-2">Since there are no holes or seams detected on the cakes, <span class="redacted top-secret">the filling needs to be loaded into the cakes before baking</span>. I thought about freezing the fudge in disk shapes and then concealing
        those into the middle of a muffin cup of cake batter, <span class="redacted top-secret">but the fudge doesn’t freeze solid in a home freezer<span>. It just gets really cold and really sticky, and it's much too messy to work with.</p>
      <p id="para-3">Going back to the drawing board, I found the clue I needed on Domino's website. The list of ingredients for the lava cakes includes <span class="redacted top-secret">“cake crumbs” and “cookie crumbs”</span> along with butter,
        eggs, sugar, flour, vanilla, and cocoa. This suggests that crumbs of prebaked cake and cookies could be combined with the other ingredients <span class="redacted top-secret">to make firmer cake “dough”</span> rather than runny cake batter.
        The soft fudge could then be spooned onto the bottom of the uncooked mini cakes, topped with more dough, and baked.</p>
      <p id="para-4">After baking the little cakes with this new technique there is no detectable seam, and the fudge inside gets warm and gooey and oozes out when you eat it, just like the real thing. <span class="redacted top-secret">Serve these up
          with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side</span> and watch the fun when everyone takes a bite.</p>
      <p id="para-5">This chocolate lava crunch cake recipe makes <span class="redacted top-secret">12 cakes</span>, and I'm adding a bunch of step photos so yours will come out perfect. You can chill any leftovers for serving later with the <span
          class="redacted top-secret">reheating instructions<span> I'm including at the end.
