# Where's Where's the Gullible Onigiri, Tohru?

This first exercise is inspired from its tutorial "Where's Sausage Dog?" So instead of making improvements on the tutorial and naming it "Where's Sausage Dog? Edition Plus," I would like to change the theme of the simulation and add images that I want to try out.

Images are from the anime called Fruit Basket and I drew them. Note that there are a lot of fan art using these images so I used images found on Google for reference (typing "fruits basket animal zodiac mochi" on Google Image page).

I wanted to incorporate zodiac signs because Chinese New Year is approaching and I wanted use the animal signs. I didn't want to use images that are different from the animal body so I thought of drawing them in something fun and cute.

I couldn't have completed the code without Pippin's and Sabine's help figuring how to trigger an "ending" state after a delay. Since I had to work in a class file, I struggle a bit to give a fun behavior to the child class and to trigger a state after a delay because they required a bit more coding vocabulary that is new to me. Nonetheless, I'm glad I ran into these issues because I can learn new ways to code!
