# Where's Tohru?

This first exercise is inspired from its tutorial "Where's Sausage Dog?" So instead of making improvements on the tutorial and naming it "Where's Sausage Dog? Edition Plus," I would like to change the theme of the simulation and add images that I want to try out.

Images are from the anime called Fruit Basket and I drew them. Note that there are a lot of fan art using these images so I used images found on Google for reference (typing "fruits basket animal zodiac mochi" on Google Image page).

I wanted to incorporate zodiac signs because Chinese New Year is approaching and I wanted use the animal signs. I didn't want to use images that are different from the animal body so I thought of drawing them in something fun and cute.
