# Images folder

This is the folder where you would keep all the images associated with your project, such as `.png`, `.jpg`, and other formats. An example image, `clown.png`, is here in case you need something to play around with.

All images were drawn by me using reference of the anime Fruits Basket's zodiac sign

Except the background images ("offering.gif", "human-tohru.png" and "ohno.jpg") that was found on Google Image

"offering.gif" was taken from a group founded on DeviantArt (https://www.deviantart.com/fruits-basket-love)

"human-tohru.png" was taken from a post from Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/FruitsBasket/comments/hsbvu1/fruits_basket_wallpapers_from_the_new_ending/)

"ohno.jpg" was taken from a post from a personal blog (https://anime.astronerdboy.com/2019/08/fruits-basket-2019-19.html)
