# Assets folder

The assets folder should contain all the non-code parts of your project. For now there are folders for image files and sound files. If you needed to use font files, for example, you would create another folder called `fonts` and put them in there.

<b>Attributing Typeface</b>
<br>
<i>Playfair Display</i> is a typeface I often use for my Google Doc or Slide files. It was taken from Google Fonts and was designed by Claus Eggers SÃ¸rensen. Playfair Display has multiple variations: Regular, Medium, Semi-bold and Bold, including its italic variations. It also has some glyphs.
