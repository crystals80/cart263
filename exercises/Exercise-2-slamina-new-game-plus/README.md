# Exercise 2: Slamina New Game Plus

This second exercise takes after its tutorial activity "Slamina"

The pointillism code was taken from p5.js and it was created by Dan Shiffman (https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). I modified the code using siunami's code (https://editor.p5js.org/siunami/sketches/HkXTkdzfN).
