# Exercise 2: Welcome to the Slamina Zoo!

This second exercise takes after its tutorial activity "Slamina" and was enhanced to make it more fun. Inspired by the corpora project from Darius Kazemi (a wonderful creative programmer worth looking up) that contains all kinds of lists in easily accessible form, I want to give it a fun theme: A visit to the Slamina Zoo!

Take a look at the corpora project: https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/animals/common.json

That said, since it is confusing to read the illegible words that had been reversed, I thought it would be nice to make the background image of the title screen blurry so that it gives a sense of abstraction. What I mean by this is that it takes time to recognize the reversed animal names and so it would take time to visualize the background image. Accordingly, the background image remains blurry to introduce the simulation. This idea decision was to show that when users almost completely decipher the reversed animal name, they usually skip the few last letters and give an answer right away. So in a funny manner, the words never get to be deciphered properly.

As someone who has a visual memory, I struggle a bit with the reverse animal words (from the tutorial), so I thought it would be nice to provide users a visual of the words. Also, I chose to change the speech language to "Japanese Female" because it sounds odd and it provides a sense of fun. Lastly, when I was brainstorming for themes and finally landed on "a visit to the zoo", I thought I could make it kind of childish so it adds more humor.
