# Phaser 3 - Game Engine Experiments

Create sprites on [Piskel App](https://www.piskelapp.com/)

See [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) for more about specific positioning of different sprites (fairly intense at first but once getting used to it, it will be a great tool rather than heavy coding individual position for each sprite)
